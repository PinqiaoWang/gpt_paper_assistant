Multi-Agent Systems Design (especially with ML components)

Relevant:
Papers proposing new architectures, frameworks, or system designs for multi-agent systems. The application domain may be Finance, Healthcare, Education, etc., but the key requirement is that the paper introduces a novel multi-agent design, coordination mechanism, or communication framework. Prefer papers where agents embody ML models, collaborate or debate, or perform distributed decision-making and learning.

Not Relevant:
Papers about generation or segmentation alone; papers where “agents” are just training heuristics; or works with no actual multi-agent architecture.

Multi-Agent Machine Learning & Debate Systems

Relevant:
Papers proposing multi-agent training, debate, or cooperation frameworks, especially where each agent represents a distinct ML model (e.g., tree-based models, neural networks, probabilistic models).
Look for systems that include: agents interacting, debating, critiquing, or voting; communication protocols or argumentation mechanisms; multi-agent decision-making to improve predictions; unified multi-agent pipelines for tabular or structured data

Not relevant:
Works where "agents" are simply optimization heuristics or swarm metaheuristics without real model-level debate or communication.

LLM for Tabular Data

Relevant:
Papers that propose unified model architectures or foundation models for tabular data, such as: TabPFN, TabZoo, TabLLM, TabTransformers models that imitate multiple ML algorithms through meta-learning architectures combining generative priors + discriminative objectives systems integrating diverse model types under a shared backbone. And also, Multi-agent approaches applied to structured data, including: agents representing heterogeneous learners; agents specializing in different subspaces or statistical views; adversarial/offline RL agents interacting to improve inference; systems that quantify debate outcomes beyond simple “choose the best model”

Not relevant:
Task-specific classifiers without generalization across ML paradigms.

Agentic AI for Finance

Relevant: I am looking for research papers on Agentic AI for Finance, specifically works where AI models operate as autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that plan, reason, use tools, and interact with financial environments. The papers should focus on systems that go beyond static prediction models and instead frame financial decision-making—such as trading, portfolio optimization, risk management, fraud detection, or research automation—as sequences of actions executed by agents. I am particularly interested in works where agents interact with external data sources or tools (for example market data APIs, pricing engines, financial databases, or simulation environments), maintain internal states or goals, and operate through explicit workflows such as information gathering, modeling, evaluation, and execution. The strongest matches will be papers that incorporate multi-agent interactions in financial settings, such as agents representing different trading strategies, market roles, or decision-making philosophies, and that study how these agents coordinate, debate, compete, or negotiate to arrive at financial decisions. I am also looking for works that leverage statistical machine learning or generative modeling to improve agent reasoning or robustness, and that provide nontrivial empirical findings—such as market simulation results, backtesting with risk-adjusted metrics, ablation studies, or evidence of emergent agent behavior in financial environments.

Not relevant: Works that only talks about existing AI's impact on Finance.
